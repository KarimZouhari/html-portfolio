<h2>Number #3</h2>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Contains the best fights out of all of them for sure and the history is really good, the animation is bad at first but it gets better with time.</p>

<hr /> 

<h2>Number #2</h2>
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>The story building carries this anime. The fights are really good and the animation is very good but the pace is horrible.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Number #1</h2>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Best story of all animes in my opinion, the fights are very good but short the animation is very good from the beginning and the writing is peak.</p>
